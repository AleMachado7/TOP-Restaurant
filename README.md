# TOP-Restaurant
Project created as part of The Odin Project curriculum


In this project all the content of the website is generated using only Javascript.
All the HTML properties and content was created with Javascript functions and some functions that I developed myself.
And to finish it we used Webpack to bundle all the "pages" of the tab content into a single js file.
